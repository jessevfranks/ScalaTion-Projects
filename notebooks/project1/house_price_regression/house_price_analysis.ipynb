The least accurate fold has an R^2 value of .9710, suggesting that this fold was the most difficult to predict. The highest fold was 0.9931, the best score of any model. Given these two values, we could expect our model to perform somewhere in this range on new data. 5-fold cross validation here is the most robust and realistic option to get an idea of how good our model is.
