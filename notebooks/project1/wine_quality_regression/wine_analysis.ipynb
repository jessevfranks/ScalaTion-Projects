    "**Outliers:**<br>\n",
    "The points shown outside the whiskers of the boxplots represent values that fall more than 1.5 × IQR from the middle 50% of the data. The boxplot flags these as potential outliers, but in this dataset a lot of these values are not errors or anomalies. The wine chemistry variables (such as sulphates, residual sugar, and chlorides) are naturally skewed (their values are not evenly distributed around the center). Because of this skewness, the standard boxplot rule identifies a large number of observations as outliers, even though they are legitimate measurements. The observations are retained to preserve the true variability of the data. Removing them could distort the relationships between variables and negatively affect the regression analysis. The presence of skewed distributions motivates the use of transformed regression models (like log, square-root, Box-Cox, or Yeo-Johnson transformations), which help stabilize variance and improve model fit without discarding valid data."

    "The decrease in R² for Ridge and Lasso is expected since regularization introduces bias in order to reduce variance and stabilize coefficient estimates under multicollinearity. Lasso’s substantial reduction in R² suggests that several predictors contribute redundant information, effectively performing feature selection by shrinking weaker effects. Lasso forces the coefficients/weights of less important, noisy, or redundant features to 0. A high shrinkage implies a high penalty parameter (lambda)."
